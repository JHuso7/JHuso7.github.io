This is a simple blog where I share my interest regarding programming and analysis, as part for me to become a Data Scientist. The opinions shared here are from me personally.

I hold a Master degree in Business Administration with Major in Economics and Minor in Finance from Norwegian University of Life Science. From before I hold a Bachelor degree in Finance from BI Norwegian Business School.

My level of programming skills in my opinion is (beginner/intermediate/advanced/professional):
- Python advanced
- SAS advanced
- SQL intermediate
- Excel intermediate
- Julia beginner
- I also consider learning Scala
